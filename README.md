### How it works
- URL shortning has been done by taking the hash of the url provided and saving it in the database along with the url, inorder to retrieve back the url from the shortened url. since hash is long i have taken the first 7 characters of the hash. To tackle the problem that two same url's will have the same shortened url, i have used unique id which is concatenated with the url and then hashed which will always give you an unique shortened url.
- Whenever a shortened URL is opened the count is also noted for analytics and it can be observed in the homepage which lists all the counts of shortened url's uptill date.
